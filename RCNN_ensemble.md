## Abstract
-  apply high-capacity CNNs to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects.

- when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task,
followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost.

## Introduction

## Object detection with R-CNN
Module 1: generates category-independent region proposals    
Module 2: a large convolutional neural network that extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each region    
Module 3: a set of classspecific linear SVMs
