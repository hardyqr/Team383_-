## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Theory
Choose one from Course 1 and Course 2. Then choose one from Course 3 and Course 4. Course 5 is about Probablistic Graphical Models and is optional.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer the combination of Course 1, Course 4 and Course 5.
<br>
Textbook 1&2 are comparably great.
<br>
colah's blog provides some intuitive and insightful understandings about Deep Learning. Worth looking at.
