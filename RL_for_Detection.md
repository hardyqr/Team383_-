# Reinforcement Learning for Object Detection
i.e. not using sliding window to obtain bounding boxes
## Active object localization with deep reinforcement learning


>In contrast to sliding windows, our approach does not follow a fixed path to search objects;
>instead, different objects in different scenes will end up in different search paths.

These papers train an intelligent agent that, given an image window, 
is capable of deciding where to focus the attention among several 
different smaller region candidates. This top-down search is efficient 
to locate small objects in images but hard to apply to 3D data since 
a 3D scene can be extremely large and 3D objectsâ€™ sizes vary from class to class.
